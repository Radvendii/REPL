Introduction to Java-REPL
To start the program, run Main. It will prompt you for an input. 
Imports will be handled normally. 
All orders("int a = 5;" and the like) will be put into main.
To enter a method, use a } at the start.
Example run:
$Java-REPL Shell
"Please begin input"
$import java.util.List;
$int a = 5;

//Note to KellerKeller, continue writing this when main is viewable.

The org folder is for importing org.apache.io.* (this can be found at http://commons.apache.org/io/)
