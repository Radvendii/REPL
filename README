Introduction to REPL in Java
To start the program, run Shell. It will prompt you for an input. 
Imports will be handled normally. 
All orders("int a = 5;" and the like) will be put into REPL.main().
To enter a method, use a } at the start of the line.
Example run($=bash prompt; >=our prompt; >>=Shell's response):
$java Shell
>import java.util.List;
>}public static String foo{return "bar";} //NOTE: as of now, you must declare every method as static.
>int a = 5;
>>5 //NOTE: doesn't work yet (won't print an "int x = y" statement)

//Note to KellerKeller, continue writing this when main is viewable.
