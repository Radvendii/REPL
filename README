Introduction to REPL in Java
To start the program, run Shell. It will prompt you for an input. 
Imports will be placed where they should go, at the beginning of the file. 
All orders("int a = 5;" and the like) will be put into REPL.main().
To enter a method, use a } at the start of the line.
Example run($=bash prompt; >=our prompt; >>=Shell's response):
$java Shell
>import java.util.List;
>}public static String foo{return "bar";}
>int a=5;
>>5 //BROKEN: won't print an "int x = y" statement

NOTES:
=all methods must be declared as static
//keep adding here

JavaSourceFromString.java: Create sourcecode from string
StringHolder.java: Holds the commands to run
REPL.java: Where the eventual code will be stored (actually in REPL.class)
RunCode.java: Interface to write to REPL.class
Makefile: Compiles everything, as of now, forces a test
testRes: That which test.java should output
The org folder is for importing org.apache.io.* (this can be found at http://commons.apache.org/io/)
